# Storheia Arena is an app made by Konstantinos Leivaditis as the final project of the Udacity iOS Developer Nano Degree. This app is made for people from two small towns of Norway, Stokmarknes and Melbu. The people of these towns can use this app to travel on a fun way from one town to the other while they are playing a quiz game. Finally, they can post messages on a live chat and communicate with each other.\

## Implementation\
\
#### The users who want to use the app, should sign in or sign up in order to start using it. On the first View, the user can see the login screen. If the user is already registered, then he can fill in the textField and press the login button in order to continue. If the user is not registered, then he should press the sign up button, fill in the fields and press the sign up button again. On that way, the user is registered and authenticated on the Database. \
#### The next screen is the menu. On the menu the user can see four buttons:\
#### 1) The Settings button. When the user presses this button, he is transferred on a view where he can see his stats and logout from the app.\
#### 2) The Quiz button. When the user presses this button, he is transferred on the quiz menu where he can choose the quiz theme. When the user chooses a quiz, he is transferred on a mapView where he can see his location and 10 regions who\'92s coordinates have been tracked. When the user enters in any of these coordinates, he is transferred on another view where he will be able to answer the quiz question. If the answer is correct, his score is updated on firebase.\
#### 4) The Virtual book button. When the user presses this button, he is transferred on a tableview where he can see all the messages posted from the users. If the user clicks the plus button, he is transferred on another view where he can post a message.\
#### 5) The About button. This button is not finished. It will include sensitive data about the app and me, so I can\'92t fill it now. Please ignore it.\
